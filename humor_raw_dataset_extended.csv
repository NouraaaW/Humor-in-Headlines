Mice produce droppings frequently because their digestive systems are built for speed and efficiency. Their high metabolism and constant feeding keep food moving through a short digestive tract, where nutrients are absorbed rapidly. A large cecum—a specialized pouch containing diverse microbes—helps break down plant material but also generates a high volume of fibrous waste. Combined, these traits allow mice to process and eliminate food within hours. So if you ever suspect you’ve got a few visitors, you’ll know soon enough—just follow the brown brick road😉

The post is archived but you can still find it here. 

Three words. Perfect joke. I never forgot it.

This summer I was stuck on crutches, so I took some beginner drawing/animation classes and made a short episode as a tribute.

This is my character Gary — he looks like Gollum in a shirt and tie — accidentally finding himself in the bathroom at the sperm bank.

I’m still a total beginner and don't really know what I am doing yet, but figured I should share it here since r/funny is where it all started.

I decided to donate blood today for the first time, the nurse had already used the large needle to suck out my blood.
She said she forgot to take samples to run tests on, so she took the smaller needles, held my hand and was trying to find a vein to use...
She asked me to tighten my hands so my veins pop, she was able to fill up 1 out of 2 containers. The next container, on the same vein, no blood left my bloodstream.
So she took another vein, immediately she pierced the needle, all my veins collapsed and faded... I was like wtf, cus I've never witnessed something like that. The nurse was like ""No no no no, why now""... 

I, dirty minded just taught of why some women complained about men not lasting long enough or. I always found that strange cus I'm like, ""Did it just stop working or something""...  Guess it can just stop working lmao

Mice produce droppings frequently because their digestive systems are built for speed and efficiency. Their high metabolism and constant feeding keep food moving through a short digestive tract, where nutrients are absorbed rapidly. A large cecum—a specialized pouch containing diverse microbes—helps break down plant material but also generates a high volume of fibrous waste. Combined, these traits allow mice to process and eliminate food within hours. So if you ever suspect you’ve got a few visitors, you’ll know soon enough—just follow the brown brick road😉

The post is archived but you can still find it here. 

Three words. Perfect joke. I never forgot it.

This summer I was stuck on crutches, so I took some beginner drawing/animation classes and made a short episode as a tribute.

This is my character Gary — he looks like Gollum in a shirt and tie — accidentally finding himself in the bathroom at the sperm bank.

I’m still a total beginner and don't really know what I am doing yet, but figured I should share it here since r/funny is where it all started.

I decided to donate blood today for the first time, the nurse had already used the large needle to suck out my blood.
She said she forgot to take samples to run tests on, so she took the smaller needles, held my hand and was trying to find a vein to use...
She asked me to tighten my hands so my veins pop, she was able to fill up 1 out of 2 containers. The next container, on the same vein, no blood left my bloodstream.
So she took another vein, immediately she pierced the needle, all my veins collapsed and faded... I was like wtf, cus I've never witnessed something like that. The nurse was like ""No no no no, why now""... 

I, dirty minded just taught of why some women complained about men not lasting long enough or. I always found that strange cus I'm like, ""Did it just stop working or something""...  Guess it can just stop working lmao

She was a career woman, smart, but most of all beautiful and sexy, who sometimes flirted with me, which made me feel uncomfortable. One day she called me and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. So I went. She was alone, and when I arrived, she whispered to me, that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome. So before I got married and committed my life to her sister, she wanted to make love to me just once?

What could I say? I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word. So, she said, I'll go to the bedroom, and if you are up for it, just come and get me. I just watched her ass as she went up the stairs. I stood there for a moment, and then turned around and went to the front door... I opened it, and stepped out of the house.

The pay is good, the accommodation is comfortable, the food is excellent, and the two show a day workload is easy. The always changing mainly elderly audience seem to enjoy his show which is unoriginal but has the polish of hundreds of repetitions. All in all, it's started out as a great gig except for one glaring issue. The captain has a talking parrot that he brings to every show. It has worked out how all the tricks are done and gives away his secrets to the audience after every trick.

\*\*\*""It's a fake water jug Squarrrrk!"" ""The rabbit is under his hat Squarrrk!"" ""The girl is hiding under a trap door Squarrrk!""\*\*\*

Now the audience finds this hilarious. So instead of coming to see a magic show the crowds are coming to see him being humiliated by a parrot, 2 shows a day, 7 days a week.

Utterly depressed and desperate, the magician struggles to find a spectacular new trick to wow the crowd and that the parrot can't work out. He eventually announces an elaborate disappearing trick involving pyrotechnics and a ring of fire, however the first night he tries it, he accidentally ignites a nearby gas line causing a catastrophic chain of explosions that causes the ship to break apart and sink almost immediately.

The next morning the sun rises on an empty ocean except for a single piece of shattered lifeboat with the magician clinging to one end and the parrot perched at the other end out of reach. The magician glares at the parrot and the parrot stares back, but not a word is said. This goes on for a day, then another day. On the third day the parrot finally breaks the silence.

The first guy says “watch this.” He pounds his beer, stands up, walks over to the barrier and jumps off the roof. To the amazement of the other two guys he pops back up, floating in the air! He kind of swims back and sits back down.

“I told you guys.”

The second guy says “that’s outstanding! I have to try it!”

He pounds his beer, runs over to the edge, and jumps off the roof. He falls to his death.

The bartender turns to the first man and says “Clark, when you’re drunk you’re a total asshole.”",,False

After a few shots of liquid courage he finally strikes up a conversation. “S’cuse me, but if I buy you a drink, will you tell me how you lost your leg?”

“Oh ay!” The pirate responds in a classic piratey accent. “We was on the high seas when a storm rolls in outta nowhere. Well, as I’m trying to batten down the hatches, a great wave comes and sweeps me overboard! Luckily, I’m able to take a deep gulp of breath because the next thing I know, me leg is stuck in the jaws of a giant clam at the bottom of the drink! I tell ya matey, if that shark hadn’t come around and bit me leg off, I would have drowned for sure.”

The man was flabbergasted and realized another story was well worth another drink, so he asked how the old sea-dog had lost his hand.

“I tell ye son, never try to steal another pirate’s booty!” The pirate slammed his hook, its point gleaming, onto the bar. “Some water-rat thought to take on me crew and we got into a right sea battle that lasted nearly a fortnight. One day, I was raising me musket over the starboard side of the ship to shoot at the devils, when a cannonball flew right through me hand, taking it and my musket to the briny deep. We won the day, but I lost me hand.”

The man was stunned at the thought of the life this pirate must have lived. He decided he had to know about his eye and so bought yet another drink for the old man, who seemed immune to the liquor.

“Oh, me eye,” he said, looking at the rum in his glass. “Well, we was just about to dock at a remote island, and as we were getting ready to cast anchor, I hear a noise from above. I peer upwards, but the sun is right in me eyes, so I don’t see…” here, the grizzled old man paused.

“Yes?”

“I didn’t see the damned seagull. Pooped right in me eye.”

The man was a bit disappointed after the other two stories and, perhaps because he had been keeping pace with the pirate’s drinks, said aloud, “Wait, you lost your eye because some bird pooped in it?!?”

“Well,” the pirate conceded, “it was me first day with the hook.”",,False

The first says, ""I want a trillion dollars."" 

""Done.  When you get home you'll find an extra trillion dollars in your bank account"" says the genie.

The second says ""I want to always be the richest person on the planet, whenever someone gets more money than me, some investment I'm in should pay off and I get back on top.""

""Done."" says the genie.

The third guy says, ""I want my right arm to spin around and not stop.""

Everyone looks at him with disbelief.  ""Are you sure?"" says the genie?

""I know what I'm doing.""

""OK, done."" says the genie, and the man's arm starts rotating around in a big circle like he's swimming with just one arm.

""Now, second wishes."" says the genie.

The first guy says ""I want to be the most handsome man on the planet.""

""Done.""  And the man became objectively and undeniably handsome.

""I want to be even more handsome than that guy,"" says the second man.

""Done."" Instantly he was transformed into a very handsome man, even moreso than the first.

The third guy takes a breath and says, ""I want my left arm to go in a circle, too; but the other direction.""

""What?"" says the genie.

""Make my left arm spin in the other direction from my right. I know what I'm doing.""

""Ok. Done."" and the man's left arm begins to waive around but where his right arm is going forward, his left is going backwards.

""Umm. . . third wishes?"" says the genie

The first man says, ""I want to be happily married to the most attractive woman in the world.""

""Done,"" says the genie.  ""Meet your wife.""  And out of the trees steps the most beautiful woman that anyone has ever seen.  She walks right up to the first guy and gives him a big hug and they kiss and they're very happy with each other.

The second guy says ""I want to be desired by every woman on the planet.  If I chat a woman up, she'll be interested in me and we'll have really good sex.""

""Done."" says the genie.

Everyone turns to the third man with his arms uncontrollably waiving about.  ""And you?"" says the genie.

""I want my head to nod up and down all the time.""

""What is wrong with you?"" asks the first guy.  ""Seriously, man, are you ok?"" asks the second.

""I. KNOW. WHAT. I'M. DOING."" says the third.

""Man, I'm just doing my job,"" says the genie.  ""Done.""  And the third man's head begins to nod uncontrollably.

One year later, the first and second men are sitting in a bar catching up with each other, waiting on their friend.  The first guy says, ""Man, my life is awesome.  The trillion dollars is growing in the stock market, I have a great house, no worries in life, my wife is gorgeous and a total tiger in the sack. I am loving this!

The second guy says, ""Totally agree, buddy.  My charity work is doing wonders for the world, I just bought a large yacht so that my enormous yacht would have a friend when we go sailing.  I am awash in the hottest women wherever I go.  Your wife *is* a tiger in the sack, and I'm just living my best life right now.

Just as they were about to play paper/scissors/rock to see which two would eat the other, one of them saw an island.
As they were friends they thought they would try the island first, see if they could find someone else to eat.

As their little boat washed up they were met by a very fat man, fattest they had ever seen.

He was there on fat solo survival stay or fsss for short.
 This is where a person who wanted to lose weight would stay for two weeks.

The island had heaps of food, but it was all natural growing and had to be picked or dug up.

The large man saw the boat and the 3 cannibals and ran towards them yelling and waving.

He had been there a week, he explained but couldn't find any of the "" plentyful"" food.

The 3 cannibals looked at each other drooling and nodded at the fat man.

He invited them back to his camp, about 100 metres from the beach.

As the fat man led the way, he complained about the lack of food, however the cannibals could see many edible plants on only that short trip alone.

Once at the camp, they they knocked the fattie out and tied him to a pole, put him over the fire and with one of the cannibals turning him began to roast him.

"" Just remember to turn him slowly Gerald"" they said to the youngest of the group, tasked with rotating their meal.

The other two left and came back 10 minutes later with a basket of potatoes they had seen growing on their walk from the beach.

They decided to make chips from the potatoes and soon had them frying below the main dish.

The large man started to wake up, but Neville, the oldest cannibal said don't worry he will breath in the smoke, that would finish him and impart a lovely subtle smoky flavour.

As the two cannibals prepared to leave again, they reminded Gerald to turn slow, for a nice even roast.

When they got back with a a salad basket, they were shocked to see a red faced Garald spin the fat man so fast that he was almost coming off the pole

At the end of class, the professor tells him that there is little more that he could teach him, and that he ought to explore the world. 

So, the prodigy first goes to Japan to explore brand new instruments. After traveling around the country for a few weeks, he settles into going back and forth between Kyoto and Tokyo. Soon enough, he has mastered enough to be considered a master at timing in both kabuk plays as well as fast-paced anime music. His friends in the Japanese music scene tell him that there's nothing else they could possibly teach him, and that he ought to continue his journey.

The prodigy's next stop is India. He travels around the sub-continent for a few weeks before stopping in Mumbai. News of his travel has already reached some of the biggest studios there, and in short order he is being taught by the best Bollywood writers in the business. Soon, he has written and preformed several hit songs and even participated in helping design some choreography for a couple. As much as his mentors in show-biz want him to stay, they admit that there is little left to learn and that if he wants to expand his horizons further, he must go somewhere else.

Thus, the prodigy tries to shake things up. He boards a flight to the remote Northern parts of Finland. After spending several days up there, he moves down to Helsinki to learn from artists there. Not too long after, the prodigy has mastered both traditional yoiking of the Sami people as well as creating perfect Finnish folk metal riffs. He progresses so quickly that his metal head friends say that they would never have guessed he was anything but a native. They suggest that if he still wants to learn more, he'll have to keep traveling.

This same story goes on for years: no matter where he goes, the prodigy wows locals with his ability to master local music. He travels back to Asia, then around Africa, and then up and down Latin America.

Yet even as his fame grew, he always had a small itch that he couldn't scratch. So, after mastering the newest instruments that he been recently introduced to, he booked tickets back home. Once he gets back, he looks through his old notes again and tries to play through the original classics. Much to his frustration, he finds keeps finding things that bother him and take him out of concentrating. His timing is off, his piano is out of tune, etcetera. The biggest problem he finds is that no matter how he sits (even after buying several different chairs and stools) or stands, he has annoying aches and pains that totally distract him.

Several months go by, and the prodigy has made absolutely no progress. After reminiscing about his professors' class, he decides to seek advice from his favorite mentor. Driving to his now retired instructors' home, he sits down and has some tea with the old man and regales him with stories of traveling the world. During a lull in the conversation, the prodigy tells his mentor about the recent problems that he's been having. The professor gives him a warm smile and a last piece of advice.

""My boy, I know just what your problem is!"" 

""Please tell me, professor!"" The prodigy pleads.

St. Peter greets them both with enthusiasm, and goes on and on about the honor of receiving two such great people simultaneously, “…which makes what I have to tell you very difficult and…awkward.”

“What’s the matter?” asks Dolly. “Yes, please speak plainly, St. Peter.” insists the Queen. “As the head of The Church of England, I believe I’ve earned the right to demand that you come to the point.”

“Well.” continues St. Peter, “ I’m afraid Heaven is very full at the moment, and can only accept one of you. 

“Oh dear!” exclaims Dolly.

“How shall we settle this matter?” asks the Queen, demonstrating her trademark pragmatism. 

St. Peter explains quickly so as to expedite the process for his two impatient clients: “Each of you must present your most treasured asset. Whoever’s is of the greatest value will be granted entry into Heaven. Dolly, we’ll start with you.”

Without hesitation, Dolly unzips her top. St. Peter watches in awe as her two perfect breasts tumble forth and land with a “thump-thump” sound on the marble table that stands before him. “Oh my, those are very lovely indeed! Well Your Majesty, I’m afraid it’s going to be difficult to follow that, but please proceed.”

Seemingly undiscouraged, the Queen thinks for a moment, open her handbag, reaches in, pulls out an old douchebag. Peter, stunned, praises the monarch, saying, “Congratulations Your Majesty! Well played! You have earned the last spot in Heaven!”

Dolly Parton is both angry and confused. “Wait a second, Peter! I show you these two, big, beautiful breasts, and she ain’t got nothin’ but a used feminine hygiene product. What gives?”

And here is my reply:

""Could you quiet that thing down?"" I shouted at Frank the Magnificent. The ragtime was surprisingly loud, given its source. I wouldn't have minded, but after the hundredth repetition of ""The Entertainer,"" it was getting to be a bit much. I was beginning to understand how ice cream truck drivers felt. At least it isn't Turkey in the Straw, I thought to myself.

For some gawdawful reason, Frank the Magnificent- ""Hey, can I just call you 'Frank?'"" I asked, startling everyone in the room as the music was suddenly silenced. ""Sorry,"" I said a little softer. ""I just feel like after reading through this particular spell, we're a bit beyond 'the Magnificent' and all.""

Frank the Magnficient- just Frank, now- acknowledged my request with a short nod. Anyway, for some reason Frank had written his spell on parchment. And not only that, on a miniature parchment scroll. The arcane symbols were in written in Arcana Lite font face, 2.5pt which meant I kept having to conjure the magnifying tool in SpellOS 10.0.

To make it worse, that stupid Clippy homonculus kept popping up and saying things like ""It looks like you're trying to turn on Accessibility options. Can I help?"" Normally, I just blast that little bastard with a Flamethrower charm, but Frank the- I mean, just Frank's choice of dried ancient parchment meant that I'd set off every arcane smoke detector within sixty miles. More likely, with Frank's luck some daemon from the third or fourth nether hells would have considered it a burnt offering and we'd all have our souls eaten for brunch.

I waved my hand in a dismissive gesture, causing Clippy to wriggle his animated eyebrows and disappear, saving me the trouble and pleasure of throttling him with my bare hands. I scowled and continued scanning the first canto of the spell. Nothing there. Just your standard invocation of dark forces and a definition of return variables. Hmm, why he didn't ensorcel this as a closure I'll never understand. Would have saved himself half a pocket dimension's worth of coding.

""Scroll!"" I murmured, having to repeat myself several times as the lilting strains of Claire de Lune began and grew in volume. ""Scroll! I mean [Jesus, Frank, can you shut that thing up?] Scroll Down!""

The scroll, obedient to my command, fell to the floor. Sigh. Clippy appeared, this time wearing a fedora. ""Are you trying to scroll the text of this parchmen- ACK!"" This time I gave into my most primal urges and slit that smug shit's throat with my athamé. It gurgled a bit and then spiraled away, bugged out eyes staring at me accusingly. I knew he'd be back, though. You can only banish Clippy. Never destroy him.

Fine. ""Scroll TEXT Down!"" I muttered, doing a two-finger swipe above the parchment. Right... Right... Nothing out of order here... Sacrifice of the soul of a small animal. For-next loop over the infinite names of the Lords of Chaos. Hell, he even initiated his array variables. Why did this stupid spell fuck up so completel- oh wait. There it is.

""Frank,"" I said, ""Please tell me you didn't write this thing in Word.""

Frank looked at me. ""Well, yeah,"" he said. ""I can't read that tiny font, so-""

I raised my finger. ""So you wrote a SPELL in a WORD PROCESSOR?"" I said, raising my voice over the crashing of Beethovan's Sonata No.29 in B-flat Major (aka the ""Hammerklavier"").

He nodded sheepishly.

""Tell me, Frank,"" I said. ""Did you think that maybe you should have turned off auto-correct?""

Though the country was small, the people lived in peace and prosperity, leading happy and fulfilling lives. The king had three beautiful and lovely princesses. From birth, each princess possessed a magical power: when they cried, their tears would turn into sparkling, priceless diamonds.

One day, the king realized he was growing old, and there was no one to inherit his kingdom or care for his daughters. So, he announced to the world:

“As everyone knows, I have three princesses. Each of them is blessed with unparalleled beauty, and their tears can turn into precious diamonds. A month from now, I will summon all outstanding men so that my daughters may each choose a husband—the chosen ones shall have the chance to inherit my kingdom and fortune!”

A month later, the castle was filled with princes, knights, and noblemen from all over the world. They were handsome, confident, and elegant. At noon, the king entered the grand hall with his three princesses. To welcome the guests, the eldest princess sang a song with a voice as pure as heaven’s melody; the second princess danced gracefully, her movements light and beautiful; the youngest princess only smiled shyly, then hid behind the king, refusing to come out. Embarrassed, the king explained that his youngest daughter had never spoken since birth and was afraid of strangers.

To win the princesses’ favor, the suitors displayed their talents—some wrote poems and painted for the eldest, some demonstrated swordsmanship and horsemanship for the second, and some offered rare treasures to the youngest. The two elder princesses were pleased and began to make their choices, but the youngest remained quietly behind her father.

The eldest princess chose a prince who vowed to conquer the world for her and carve her name on every castle. The second princess chose a rich merchant’s son who promised to build her the most splendid palace filled with treasures. The youngest princess, however, only shook her head at them all.

Just as the king was about to announce the results, a young shepherd stepped forward from the crowd. He walked straight to the youngest princess and whispered something in her ear. The princess suddenly smiled radiantly and took his hand without hesitation. And so, each princess found her companion.



Five years passed.

The eldest princess’s husband used her diamond tears to raise an army and conquer lands far and wide. Every castle he seized bore her name. Her name became famous across the world, and she believed herself happy.

The second princess’s husband used her diamond tears as capital, growing his business ever larger. Soon he no longer needed the diamonds at all. A true merchant’s son, he amassed immense wealth. Though he had yet to build the grandest palace, the second princess was content. She too believed herself happy.

The youngest princess and the shepherd traveled the world together before settling in a quiet, beautiful valley. The shepherd spent half a month building a wooden house with straw, crafting furniture by hand. Behind their house, they grew vegetables and fenced the garden themselves. The princess transplanted wildflowers she found along the way into her garden; she didn’t know their names, but seeing them each day made her smile.

At dusk, they fished by the lake or counted the stars. They were poor but lived joyfully. Gradually, the youngest princess began to speak—for the first time in her life. She only spoke to the shepherd, chattering all day about clouds, fish, birds, butterflies, and anything else that came to mind. The shepherd would sit quietly by the lake, listening until she fell asleep mid-sentence, then carry her back inside.

One day, the king fell gravely ill and summoned his daughters and their husbands. He was surprised to see the youngest princess and her husband wearing clean but patched clothes. Curious, he asked why they lived in poverty—after all, a single tear from her could buy an entire clothing shop.

The king asked the youngest princess, “What did the shepherd whisper to you that day?” 

She replied, “He said, ‘Even though your tears can turn into the most precious diamonds, I would rather live poor all my life than ever see you cry.’” 

The shepherd added, “I have never let her cry.”

The king immediately decided to pass the throne to the shepherd.

Perhaps everyone has their own idea of happiness—there is never just one answer. But only the shepherd truly understood what it meant to cherish someone.

The most precious tears are not the ones that turn into diamonds, but the ones that never fall—because those who truly love you will never let you cry.

The king passed away, and the shepherd immediately inherited the throne. After the coronation ceremony, the shepherd—now wearing the crown—returned to the royal palace. The little princess gently removed the crown from his head, helped him take off his ceremonial robes, crossed his waist with her legs, then gently licked the shepherd's ear and said:

""Now you can fuck me till I cry.""

""Hello?""

“Hello, this is Tom Duffy. Could I please speak with Jessica Kinley?”

The response I got from him was an ungodly, insane screech: “**GET THE RIGHT FUCKING NUMBER**!” ​ And he hung up.  That totally unexpected rudeness really pissed me off. 

When I checked Jessica’s number again, I found that I had mistakenly transposed the last two digits.  After hanging up with Jessica, I decided to call the first “wrong” number again.

When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, “**YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE!”**, and hung up.  I felt much better.  I wrote  down his number with the word “asshole” next to it and put it on speed dial.  Every couple of weeks, when I was having a really shitty day, I’d call him up and yell, ""**YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE!”**, and then hang up.  ​It would always cheer me up.

​​One day I was at the store, all set to pull into a parking spot, when some dude in a black 2010 BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot​ ​I had been patiently waiting for.  ​I hit the horn and protested that I had been waiting for that spot for 5 minutes, but the asshole flipped me off and just walked away.  

Then, I noticed a “For Sale” sign in his back window, so I wrote down the number, and a couple days later (right after calling Asshole #1), I decided that I should call the BMW asshole as well.

'Hello, are you the man with the black 2010 BMW for sale?'

“Yes I am.”

“Is it still available, and could I come by some time to check it out?”

“Sure.  My address is 71 Greenwood Avenue in Bronxville.  It’s a red brick house on the corner and the car’s parked right out in front.”

“Sounds good.  What’s your name, by the way?”

“My name is Jack Daniels.”

“Say, when’s a good time to catch you, Jack?”

“I’m home every evening after six.”

“Listen, Jack, can I tell you something?”

“Yes?”

“Jack, **YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE!""**

​Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.  The next day, sudden inspiration struck!

I called Asshole #1:

“Hello.”

“**YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE!**”, but this time I didn’t hang up.

“Are you still there?”

“Yeah.  Asshole.”

He screamed, “**STOP. CALLING. MEEEEEEEEE**!”

“Make me, asshole.”

“Who the fuck are you?”

“My name is Jack Daniels.”

“Yeah? Where do you live?”

“Listen, asshole, I live at 71 Greenwood Avenue in Bronxville.  A red brick house on the corner with a black Beemer parked in front.”

“I’m coming over right now, Daniels, and you’d better start saying your fucking prayers.”

“Oooooh! Listen to the tough guy.  Like I’m really scared, asshole.”  And hung up.

Next, I called Asshole #2:

“Hello?”

“Hello, asshole.”

“**IF I EVER FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE…**”

“You’ll what, tough guy?”

“**I’LL KICK YOUR ASS, THAT’S WHAT!**”

 “Well, asshole, here’s your chance.  I’m coming over right now.”

Then I hung up and immediately called the cops, telling them that I was on my way over to 71 Greenwood Avenue in Bronxville to kill a registered sex offender who keeps exposing himself to my daughter’s 3^(rd) grade class at recess. 

Then I called Channel 7 Eyewitness News to report a civil unrest situation on Greenwood Avenue in Bronxville and things are spinning out of control.  Then, I got in my car and headed over to Bronxville.

I got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the living shit out of each other, surrounded by 7 squad cars, with an overhead news chopper hovering over the scene, with a news crew reporting on the action. 

 I feel much better now. ",,False

The security guard tells them that the truck that was supposed to deliver the port-a-potty’s turned over on the motorway so they don’t have the facilities for a full crowd, and have stopped sales.

Thinking fast Mick confers with Patrick then asks “Could you slip us in for $100?”
The guard laughs and says, look son, it’s a quarter full, but the kegs were already tapped for a full crowd so they’ve slashed the prices, no lines, cheap beer, it’s paradise in there mate, the guy before you paid me $500.
They walk away and wonder how they would come up with $1000…….

They are standing next to a gap in the fence when they are nearly splashed by someone sticking themselves through the fence and pissing on the pavement. They stare in shock and then turn look up and down the fence to see there are similar puddles beside every gap they can see.

Mick is struck with an idea, “Watch this Patrick!” He says and creeps up to the gap, after a few seconds, something pokes through and he grabs it… with a harsh and threatening voice he says “I’ve got a knife, throw $50 bucks over the fence or I’ll cut it off!!!!” It was scant seconds before a crumpled up note was thrown over the fence and he had to catch it before it landed in the puddle.

“Right” he says, “you go that way, I’ll go this way and we’ll meet up near that guard in 15 minutes and see how we did.”

Mick and Patrick meet just out of earshot of the guard and Mick tells Patrick “I got $600 & if you got half as much as that we’ll get in and turn a profit!!!”

Neither of them had ever been to Japan before, so they decided to make a trip out of it.

They arrive the night before the big game, and decide to do some exploring. Soon enough, they end up at a brothel.  


G: ""I've never had a Japanese girl before..""   
L: ""Me neither, but I've heard they are the best!""   
G:""Does it matter that we cant speak any Japanese?""   
L: ""It will be fine, these girls speak the language of love, and cash."" 

The next morning the two of them meet up and discuss their escapades.

L: ""I had the best time last night, she really showed me some new tricks. How did your night go?""  
G: ""Well, everything went fine... eventually... but these Japanese girls have too much stamina""  
L: ""What do you mean?""  
G: ""Well, the lights were off, I thought that was part of the culture. Once we took our clothes off and I got going, she started saying ""Ata Ka, Ata Ka"". Sounded like she was urging me on, so I started going a bit faster. Then she kept moaning ""Ata Ka, Ata Ka."" so I thought, this girl must like it rough. So I start really giving it to her. But still this girl is yelling to me ""Ata Ka, Ata Ka"" so I pounded her as hard as I could until I was completely spent. At least I learned a little bit of Japanese.""  
L: ""Well hopefully you still have enough energy to watch the game haha!""

So they both went off to watch the soccer game.

At some point during the match, all the fans from the opposing team stand up in unison and shout ""Ata Ka, Ata Ka!"" and Larry turns to Gary confused, wondering if they want their team to play harder? Eventually another ball gets kicked and the fans once again stand and yell ""Ata Ka, Ata Ka!"". Gary thinks to himself ""Wow these Japanese are relentless!"". Finally there was a Japanese man sitting next to Gary who stands and yells ""Ata Ka, Ata Ka!!!"" and Gary can't help himself, turns to the man and asks:

""What does 'Ata Ka, Ata Ka' mean? Attack? Go harder?""

The Japanese man replied angrily: ""No, 'Ata Ka Ata Ka' means 'It's out.'

Thinking maybe they were close to the resort, they looked for a store or gas station where they could ask directions. Finding no other place, they saw a farmhouse with the lights on and pulled into the driveway. 

A lady answered the door and she told them the roads were too treacherous for those unfamiliar with the area. They asked if they could rent a room or a couch and stay there overnight. The lady explained that she is a recent widow, and the neighbors know her too well. Seeing an extra vehicle at her house overnight would be a very bad idea.

Still though she was concerned for their well-being and proposed they pull their car into the horse barn and sleep there until dawn.
She said her husband had gotten rid of the horses before his death so the barn was quiet and there was a sink and toilet they could use. 
She also offered to bring them towels, blankets, and some food. 
The buddies accepted this offer knowing it was getting dark fast and they had no other options.

At dawn they awoke and she delivered some breakfast and hot coffee for the road.

About nine months later they were having drinks and buddy 1 moved the conversation back to their ski trip. Buddy 2 talked about the great time they had and how they should do it again.

 Buddy 1 asks his friend, ""that night, while we slept in the barn, did you happen to sneak out of the car and into the widow's house while I slept?"" 
Buddy 2, a bit sheepishly says, ""yes.""
Buddy 1 asks, ""and did you and the widow have fun?""

There was only one little thing bothering me: her beautiful younger sister.
My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight miniskirts, and generally was bra-less. One day, the “little” sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn’t overcome.

She told me: “I want to make love to you just once before you get married and commit your life to my sister.” I was in total shock and couldn’t say a word.

She said: “I’m going upstairs to my bedroom — if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.” She went upstairs and, as she did, tossed down her panties.

I stood there stunned for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door. I headed toward my car.

Lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping! With tears in his eyes, my future father-in-law hugged me and said, “We are very happy you have passed our little test. We couldn’t ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.”

The pay is good, the accommodation is comfortable, the food is excellent, and the two show a day workload is easy. The always changing mainly elderly audience seem to enjoy his show which is unoriginal but has the polish of hundreds of repetitions. All in all, it's started out as a great gig except for one glaring issue. The captain has a talking parrot that he brings to every show. It has worked out how all the tricks are done and gives away his secrets to the audience after every trick.

\*\*\*""It's a fake water jug Squarrrrk!"" ""The rabbit is under his hat Squarrrk!"" ""The girl is hiding under a trap door Squarrrk!""\*\*\*

Now the audience finds this hilarious. So instead of coming to see a magic show the crowds are coming to see him being humiliated by a parrot, 2 shows a day, 7 days a week.

Utterly depressed and desperate, the magician struggles to find a spectacular new trick to wow the crowd and that the parrot can't work out. He eventually announces an elaborate disappearing trick involving pyrotechnics and a ring of fire, however the first night he tries it, he accidentally ignites a nearby gas line causing a catastrophic chain of explosions that causes the ship to break apart and sink almost immediately.

The next morning the sun rises on an empty ocean except for a single piece of shattered lifeboat with the magician clinging to one end and the parrot perched at the other end out of reach. The magician glares at the parrot and the parrot stares back, but not a word is said. This goes on for a day, then another day. On the third day the parrot finally breaks the silence.

The first says, ""I want a trillion dollars.""

The second says ""I want to always be the richest person on the planet, whenever someone gets more money than me, some investment I'm in should pay off and I get back on top.""

""Done."" says the genie.

The third guy says, ""I want my right arm to spin around and not stop.""

Everyone looks at him with disbelief.  ""Are you sure?"" says the genie?

""I know what I'm doing.""

""Done.""  And the man became objectively and undeniably handsome.

""I want to be even more handsome than that guy,"" says the second man.

""Done."" Instantly he was transformed into a very handsome man, even moreso than the first.

The third guy takes a breath and says, ""I want my left arm to go in a circle, too; but the other direction.""

""What?"" says the genie.

""Make my left arm spin in the other direction from my right. I know what I'm doing.""

""Ok. Done."" and the man's left arm begins to waive around but where his right arm is going forward, his left is going backwards.

""Umm. . . third wishes?"" says the genie

The first man says, ""I want to be happily married to the most attractive woman in the world.""

""Done,"" says the genie.  ""Meet your wife.""  And out of the trees steps the most beautiful woman that anyone has ever seen.  She walks right up to the first guy and gives him a big hug and they kiss and they're very happy with each other.

The second guy says ""I want to be desired by every woman on the planet.  If I chat a woman up, she'll be interested in me and we'll have really good sex.""

""Done."" says the genie.

Everyone turns to the third man with his arms uncontrollably waiving about.  ""And you?"" says the genie.

""I. KNOW. WHAT. I'M. DOING."" says the third.

""Man, I'm just doing my job,"" says the genie.  ""Done.""  And the third man's head begins to nod uncontrollably.

The trillion dollars is growing in the stock market, I have a great house, no worries in life, my wife is gorgeous and a total tiger in the sack. I am loving this!

""You can understand what I'm saying?"" asked the officer.
Again, the monkey nodded his head up and down.

The monkey pretended to have a can in his hand and turned it up by his mouth.
""They were drinking?"" asked the officer. 
""Yes.""

The monkey pinched his fingers together and held them to his mouth. ""They were smoking marijuana?"" 
""Yes.""

The monkey motioned ""making love.""

""Yes.""
""What were you doing during all this?""

After a few shots of liquid courage he finally strikes up a conversation. “S’cuse me, but if I buy you a drink, will you tell me how you lost your leg?”

“Oh ay!” The pirate responds in a classic piratey accent. “We was on the high seas when a storm rolls in outta nowhere. Well, as I’m trying to batten down the hatches, a great wave comes and sweeps me overboard! Luckily, I’m able to take a deep gulp of breath because the next thing I know, me leg is stuck in the jaws of a giant clam at the bottom of the drink! I tell ya matey, if that shark hadn’t come around and bit me leg off, I would have drowned for sure.”

The man was flabbergasted and realized another story was well worth another drink, so he asked how the old sea-dog had lost his hand.

“I tell ye son, never try to steal another pirate’s booty!” The pirate slammed his hook, its point gleaming, onto the bar. “Some water-rat thought to take on me crew and we got into a right sea battle that lasted nearly a fortnight. One day, I was raising me musket over the starboard side of the ship to shoot at the devils, when a cannonball flew right through me hand, taking it and my musket to the briny deep. We won the day, but I lost me hand.”

The man was stunned at the thought of the life this pirate must have lived. He decided he had to know about his eye and so bought yet another drink for the old man, who seemed immune to the liquor.

“Oh, me eye,” he said, looking at the rum in his glass. “Well, we was just about to dock at a remote island, and as we were getting ready to cast anchor, I hear a noise from above. I peer upwards, but the sun is right in me eyes, so I don’t see…” here, the grizzled old man paused.

“Yes?”

“I didn’t see the damned seagull. Pooped right in me eye.”

The man was a bit disappointed after the other two stories and, perhaps because he had been keeping pace with the pirate’s drinks, said aloud, “Wait, you lost your eye because some bird pooped in it?!?”

Just as they were about to play paper/scissors/rock to see which two would eat the other, one of them saw an island.
As they were friends they thought they would try the island first, see if they could find someone else to eat.

As their little boat washed up they were met by a very fat man, fattest they had ever seen.

He was there on fat solo survival stay or fsss for short.
 This is where a person who wanted to lose weight would stay for two weeks.

The island had heaps of food, but it was all natural growing and had to be picked or dug up.

The large man saw the boat and the 3 cannibals and ran towards them yelling and waving.

He had been there a week, he explained but couldn't find any of the "" plentyful"" food.

The 3 cannibals looked at each other drooling and nodded at the fat man.

He invited them back to his camp, about 100 metres from the beach.

As the fat man led the way, he complained about the lack of food, however the cannibals could see many edible plants on only that short trip alone.

Once at the camp, they they knocked the fattie out and tied him to a pole, put him over the fire and with one of the cannibals turning him began to roast him.

"" Just remember to turn him slowly Gerald"" they said to the youngest of the group, tasked with rotating their meal.

The other two left and came back 10 minutes later with a basket of potatoes they had seen growing on their walk from the beach.

They decided to make chips from the potatoes and soon had them frying below the main dish.

The large man started to wake up, but Neville, the oldest cannibal said don't worry he will breath in the smoke, that would finish him and impart a lovely subtle smoky flavour.

As the two cannibals prepared to leave again, they reminded Gerald to turn slow, for a nice even roast.

When they got back with a a salad basket, they were shocked to see a red faced Garald spin the fat man so fast that he was almost coming off the pole

(LONG),0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1o6ovxz/what_someone_discovered_you_could_write_magic/,1,1760469483.0,lendergle,"This was a reply I wrote to a /r/writingprompt post a few years back.  I thought it might belong here.  
  
The full prompt was:  
>  [WP] Magic is discovered to be real. The catch? Spells are just like computer programs: difficult to write, and even harder to do correct the first try. You're a spell bug tester, and you've seen just about everything go wrong, but today's typo is on a whole other level...  
  
And here is my reply:

""Could you quiet that thing down?"" I shouted at Frank the Magnificent. The ragtime was surprisingly loud, given its source. I wouldn't have minded, but after the hundredth repetition of ""The Entertainer,"" it was getting to be a bit much. I was beginning to understand how ice cream truck drivers felt. At least it isn't Turkey in the Straw, I thought to myself.

For some gawdawful reason, Frank the Magnificent- ""Hey, can I just call you 'Frank?'"" I asked, startling everyone in the room as the music was suddenly silenced. ""Sorry,"" I said a little softer. ""I just feel like after reading through this particular spell, we're a bit beyond 'the Magnificent' and all.""

Frank the Magnficient- just Frank, now- acknowledged my request with a short nod. Anyway, for some reason Frank had written his spell on parchment. And not only that, on a miniature parchment scroll. The arcane symbols were in written in Arcana Lite font face, 2.5pt which meant I kept having to conjure the magnifying tool in SpellOS 10.0.

To make it worse, that stupid Clippy homonculus kept popping up and saying things like ""It looks like you're trying to turn on Accessibility options. Can I help?"" Normally, I just blast that little bastard with a Flamethrower charm, but Frank the- I mean, just Frank's choice of dried ancient parchment meant that I'd set off every arcane smoke detector within sixty miles. More likely, with Frank's luck some daemon from the third or fourth nether hells would have considered it a burnt offering and we'd all have our souls eaten for brunch.

I waved my hand in a dismissive gesture, causing Clippy to wriggle his animated eyebrows and disappear, saving me the trouble and pleasure of throttling him with my bare hands. I scowled and continued scanning the first canto of the spell. Nothing there. Just your standard invocation of dark forces and a definition of return variables. Hmm, why he didn't ensorcel this as a closure I'll never understand. Would have saved himself half a pocket dimension's worth of coding.

""Scroll!"" I murmured, having to repeat myself several times as the lilting strains of Claire de Lune began and grew in volume. ""Scroll! I mean [Jesus, Frank, can you shut that thing up?] Scroll Down!""

The scroll, obedient to my command, fell to the floor. Sigh. Clippy appeared, this time wearing a fedora. ""Are you trying to scroll the text of this parchmen- ACK!"" This time I gave into my most primal urges and slit that smug shit's throat with my athamé. It gurgled a bit and then spiraled away, bugged out eyes staring at me accusingly. I knew he'd be back, though. You can only banish Clippy. Never destroy him.

Fine. ""Scroll TEXT Down!"" I muttered, doing a two-finger swipe above the parchment. Right... Right... Nothing out of order here... Sacrifice of the soul of a small animal. For-next loop over the infinite names of the Lords of Chaos. Hell, he even initiated his array variables. Why did this stupid spell fuck up so completel- oh wait. There it is.

At the end of class, the professor tells him that there is little more that he could teach him, and that he ought to explore the world. 

So, the prodigy first goes to Japan to explore brand new instruments. After traveling around the country for a few weeks, he settles into going back and forth between Kyoto and Tokyo. Soon enough, he has mastered enough to be considered a master at timing in both kabuk plays as well as fast-paced anime music. His friends in the Japanese music scene tell him that there's nothing else they could possibly teach him, and that he ought to continue his journey.

The prodigy's next stop is India. He travels around the sub-continent for a few weeks before stopping in Mumbai. News of his travel has already reached some of the biggest studios there, and in short order he is being taught by the best Bollywood writers in the business. Soon, he has written and preformed several hit songs and even participated in helping design some choreography for a couple. As much as his mentors in show-biz want him to stay, they admit that there is little left to learn and that if he wants to expand his horizons further, he must go somewhere else.

Thus, the prodigy tries to shake things up. He boards a flight to the remote Northern parts of Finland. After spending several days up there, he moves down to Helsinki to learn from artists there. Not too long after, the prodigy has mastered both traditional yoiking of the Sami people as well as creating perfect Finnish folk metal riffs. He progresses so quickly that his metal head friends say that they would never have guessed he was anything but a native. They suggest that if he still wants to learn more, he'll have to keep traveling.

This same story goes on for years: no matter where he goes, the prodigy wows locals with his ability to master local music. He travels back to Asia, then around Africa, and then up and down Latin America.

Yet even as his fame grew, he always had a small itch that he couldn't scratch. So, after mastering the newest instruments that he been recently introduced to, he booked tickets back home. Once he gets back, he looks through his old notes again and tries to play through the original classics. Much to his frustration, he finds keeps finding things that bother him and take him out of concentrating. His timing is off, his piano is out of tune, etcetera. The biggest problem he finds is that no matter how he sits (even after buying several different chairs and stools) or stands, he has annoying aches and pains that totally distract him.

Several months go by, and the prodigy has made absolutely no progress. After reminiscing about his professors' class, he decides to seek advice from his favorite mentor. Driving to his now retired instructors' home, he sits down and has some tea with the old man and regales him with stories of traveling the world. During a lull in the conversation, the prodigy tells his mentor about the recent problems that he's been having. The professor gives him a warm smile and a last piece of advice.

""My boy, I know just what your problem is!"" 

""Please tell me, professor!"" The prodigy pleads.

""Don't worry yourself too much. Sooner or later everyone suffers from Bach problems.""",,False

Finally there was a Japanese man sitting next to Gary who stands and yells ""Ata Ka, Ata Ka!!!"" and Gary can't help himself, turns to the man and asks:

""What does 'Ata Ka, Ata Ka' mean? Attack? Go harder?""

The Japanese man replied angrily: ""No, 'Ata Ka Ata Ka' means 'It's out.'

Though the country was small, the people lived in peace and prosperity, leading happy and fulfilling lives. The king had three beautiful and lovely princesses. From birth, each princess possessed a magical power: when they cried, their tears would turn into sparkling, priceless diamonds.

One day, the king realized he was growing old, and there was no one to inherit his kingdom or care for his daughters. So, he announced to the world:

“As everyone knows, I have three princesses. Each of them is blessed with unparalleled beauty, and their tears can turn into precious diamonds. A month from now, I will summon all outstanding men so that my daughters may each choose a husband—the chosen ones shall have the chance to inherit my kingdom and fortune!”

A month later, the castle was filled with princes, knights, and noblemen from all over the world. They were handsome, confident, and elegant. At noon, the king entered the grand hall with his three princesses. To welcome the guests, the eldest princess sang a song with a voice as pure as heaven’s melody; the second princess danced gracefully, her movements light and beautiful; the youngest princess only smiled shyly, then hid behind the king, refusing to come out. Embarrassed, the king explained that his youngest daughter had never spoken since birth and was afraid of strangers.

To win the princesses’ favor, the suitors displayed their talents—some wrote poems and painted for the eldest, some demonstrated swordsmanship and horsemanship for the second, and some offered rare treasures to the youngest. The two elder princesses were pleased and began to make their choices, but the youngest remained quietly behind her father.

The eldest princess chose a prince who vowed to conquer the world for her and carve her name on every castle. The second princess chose a rich merchant’s son who promised to build her the most splendid palace filled with treasures. The youngest princess, however, only shook her head at them all.

Just as the king was about to announce the results, a young shepherd stepped forward from the crowd. He walked straight to the youngest princess and whispered something in her ear. The princess suddenly smiled radiantly and took his hand without hesitation. And so, each princess found her companion.



Five years passed.

The eldest princess’s husband used her diamond tears to raise an army and conquer lands far and wide. Every castle he seized bore her name. Her name became famous across the world, and she believed herself happy.

The second princess’s husband used her diamond tears as capital, growing his business ever larger. Soon he no longer needed the diamonds at all. A true merchant’s son, he amassed immense wealth. Though he had yet to build the grandest palace, the second princess was content. She too believed herself happy.

The youngest princess and the shepherd traveled the world together before settling in a quiet, beautiful valley. The shepherd spent half a month building a wooden house with straw, crafting furniture by hand. Behind their house, they grew vegetables and fenced the garden themselves. The princess transplanted wildflowers she found along the way into her garden; she didn’t know their names, but seeing them each day made her smile.

At dusk, they fished by the lake or counted the stars. They were poor but lived joyfully. Gradually, the youngest princess began to speak—for the first time in her life. She only spoke to the shepherd, chattering all day about clouds, fish, birds, butterflies, and anything else that came to mind. The shepherd would sit quietly by the lake, listening until she fell asleep mid-sentence, then carry her back inside.

One day, the king fell gravely ill and summoned his daughters and their husbands. He was surprised to see the youngest princess and her husband wearing clean but patched clothes. Curious, he asked why they lived in poverty—after all, a single tear from her could buy an entire clothing shop.

The king asked the youngest princess, “What did the shepherd whisper to you that day?” 

She replied, “He said, ‘Even though your tears can turn into the most precious diamonds, I would rather live poor all my life than ever see you cry.’” 

The shepherd added, “I have never let her cry.”

The king immediately decided to pass the throne to the shepherd.

Perhaps everyone has their own idea of happiness—there is never just one answer. But only the shepherd truly understood what it meant to cherish someone.

The most precious tears are not the ones that turn into diamonds, but the ones that never fall—because those who truly love you will never let you cry.

The king passed away, and the shepherd immediately inherited the throne. After the coronation ceremony, the shepherd—now wearing the crown—returned to the royal palace. The little princess gently removed the crown from his head, helped him take off his ceremonial robes, crossed his waist with her legs, then gently licked the shepherd's ear and said:

""Now you can fuck me till I cry.""

St. Peter greets them both with enthusiasm, and goes on and on about the honor of receiving two such great people simultaneously, “…which makes what I have to tell you very difficult and…awkward.”

“What’s the matter?” asks Dolly. “Yes, please speak plainly, St. Peter.” insists the Queen. “As the head of The Church of England, I believe I’ve earned the right to demand that you come to the point.”

“Well.” continues St. Peter, “ I’m afraid Heaven is very full at the moment, and can only accept one of you. 

“Oh dear!” exclaims Dolly.

“How shall we settle this matter?” asks the Queen, demonstrating her trademark pragmatism. 

St. Peter explains quickly so as to expedite the process for his two impatient clients: “Each of you must present your most treasured asset. Whoever’s is of the greatest value will be granted entry into Heaven. Dolly, we’ll start with you.”

Without hesitation, Dolly unzips her top. St. Peter watches in awe as her two perfect breasts tumble forth and land with a “thump-thump” sound on the marble table that stands before him. “Oh my, those are very lovely indeed! Well Your Majesty, I’m afraid it’s going to be difficult to follow that, but please proceed.”

Seemingly undiscouraged, the Queen thinks for a moment, open her handbag, reaches in, pulls out an old douchebag. Peter, stunned, praises the monarch, saying, “Congratulations Your Majesty! Well played! You have earned the last spot in Heaven!”

Dolly Parton is both angry and confused. “Wait a second, Peter! I show you these two, big, beautiful breasts, and she ain’t got nothin’ but a used feminine hygiene product. What gives?”

""Hello?""

“Hello, this is Tom Duffy. Could I please speak with Jessica Kinley?”

The response I got from him was an ungodly, insane screech: “**GET THE RIGHT FUCKING NUMBER**!” ​ And he hung up.  That totally unexpected rudeness really pissed me off. 

When I checked Jessica’s number again, I found that I had mistakenly transposed the last two digits.  After hanging up with Jessica, I decided to call the first “wrong” number again.

When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, “**YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE!”**, and hung up.  I felt much better.  I wrote  down his number with the word “asshole” next to it and put it on speed dial.  Every couple of weeks, when I was having a really shitty day, I’d call him up and yell, ""**YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE!”**, and then hang up.  ​It would always cheer me up.

​​One day I was at the store, all set to pull into a parking spot, when some dude in a black 2010 BMW cut me off and pulled into the spot​ ​I had been patiently waiting for.  ​I hit the horn and protested that I had been waiting for that spot for 5 minutes, but the asshole flipped me off and just walked away.  

Then, I noticed a “For Sale” sign in his back window, so I wrote down the number, and a couple days later (right after calling Asshole #1), I decided that I should call the BMW asshole as well.

'Hello, are you the man with the black 2010 BMW for sale?'

“Yes I am.”

“Is it still available, and could I come by some time to check it out?”

“Sure.  My address is 71 Greenwood Avenue in Bronxville.  It’s a red brick house on the corner and the car’s parked right out in front.”

“Sounds good.  What’s your name, by the way?”

“My name is Jack Daniels.”

“Say, when’s a good time to catch you, Jack?”

“I’m home every evening after six.”

“Listen, Jack, can I tell you something?”

“Yes?”

“Jack, **YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE!""**

​Then I hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.  The next day, sudden inspiration struck!

I called Asshole #1:

“Hello.”

“**YOU’RE AN ASSHOLE!**”, but this time I didn’t hang up.

“Are you still there?”

“Yeah.  Asshole.”

He screamed, “**STOP. CALLING. MEEEEEEEEE**!”

“Make me, asshole.”

“Who the fuck are you?”

“My name is Jack Daniels.”

“Yeah? Where do you live?”

“Listen, asshole, I live at 71 Greenwood Avenue in Bronxville.  A red brick house on the corner with a black Beemer parked in front.”

“I’m coming over right now, Daniels, and you’d better start saying your fucking prayers.”

“Oooooh! Listen to the tough guy.  Like I’m really scared, asshole.”  And hung up.

Next, I called Asshole #2:

“Hello?”

“Hello, asshole.”

“**IF I EVER FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE…**”

“You’ll what, tough guy?”

“**I’LL KICK YOUR ASS, THAT’S WHAT!**”

 “Well, asshole, here’s your chance.  I’m coming over right now.”

Then I hung up and immediately called the cops, telling them that I was on my way over to 71 Greenwood Avenue in Bronxville to kill a registered sex offender who keeps exposing himself to my daughter’s 3^(rd) grade class at recess. 

Then I called Channel 7 Eyewitness News to report a civil unrest situation on Greenwood Avenue in Bronxville and things are spinning out of control.  Then, I got in my car and headed over to Bronxville.

I got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the living shit out of each other, surrounded by 7 squad cars, with an overhead news chopper hovering over the scene, with a news crew reporting on the action.

Thinking maybe they were close to the resort, they looked for a store or gas station where they could ask directions. Finding no other place, they saw a farmhouse with the lights on and pulled into the driveway. 

A lady answered the door and she told them the roads were too treacherous for those unfamiliar with the area. They asked if they could rent a room or a couch and stay there overnight. The lady explained that she is a recent widow, and the neighbors know her too well. Seeing an extra vehicle at her house overnight would be a very bad idea.

Still though she was concerned for their well-being and proposed they pull their car into the horse barn and sleep there until dawn.
She said her husband had gotten rid of the horses before his death so the barn was quiet and there was a sink and toilet they could use. 
She also offered to bring them towels, blankets, and some food. 
The buddies accepted this offer knowing it was getting dark fast and they had no other options.

At dawn they awoke and she delivered some breakfast and hot coffee for the road.

About nine months later they were having drinks and buddy 1 moved the conversation back to their ski trip. Buddy 2 talked about the great time they had and how they should do it again.

 Buddy 1 asks his friend, ""that night, while we slept in the barn, did you happen to sneak out of the car and into the widow's house while I slept?"" 
Buddy 2, a bit sheepishly says, ""yes.""
Buddy 1 asks, ""and did you and the widow have fun?"" 
Buddy 2, really concerned now answers, ""yes.""
Buddy 1 continues and asks, ""and did you happen to use my name?""
Buddy 2, really nervous at this point responds, ""well, er, I may have, why?""
Buddy 1, ""well I just got a letter from her attorney and apparently she had the greatest night ever and when she died, she left her entire estate to me.""",,False

The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""  
  
The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  
  
The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  
  
The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""  
  
The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  
  
It's unbelievable.  
  
The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""  
  
The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""",,False

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... 

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

Sid, the Dragon Slayer, obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death, should he try to touch them, but he had to try.


One day Sid revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Nathan


the Erudite lawyer, the King's chief adviser. Nathan thought about this and said that he could arrange for Sid to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause, Sid readily agreed to the scheme.


The next day, Nathan got a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.


Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Nathan informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and Nathan advised that only the saliva of Sid would work as the antidote to cure the itch.


The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Sid to their chambers. Nathan then slipped Sid the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Sid worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Sid left satisfied and hailed as a hero.


Upon returning to his chamber, Sid found Nathan demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Sid couldn't have cared less knowing that Nathan could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

I want a god damn new baseball glove, and I want it put under the god damn Christmas tree.  And Santa, I want a god damn new bike and I want it put under a god damn tarp in the god damn shed.”

Santa thought about it and said “Here’s what we’ll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we’ll put a pile of dog poop.”  The parents agreed to try Santa’s plan.

On Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed.  Seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the Christmas tree and checked underneath.

Finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door.  

Finding a tarp in the shed, he quickly pulled back the tarp and found yet another pile of poop.

The man then orders a beer, and walks away

The man walks back, and bets the bartender $1000 that he can piss directly into a shot glass while running, with 2 attempts

The bartender knows for a fact that this is impossible, and agrees to the bet

On attempt 1, the man gets piss everywhere, and none in the shot glass

The bartender smirks, with high hopes

On attempt 2, the man once again pisses everywhere in the bar, except for the glass

The bartender jumps up and down in excitement, knowing that he has won

Then another man in the corner of the bar screams 'FUCK'

When the bartender asks what the problem is, the man says,  
""That asshole just bet me $10,000 that he could piss all over the bar, and that you would be happy""

They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.

One day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher’s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.

Once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! “Thank you, young men” said the fairy, “Your hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?”

“This is my friend Set, and you can call me ‘Ep’”, said Amenhotep.

“Very well, Ep” said the fairy “What is the desire of your heart?”

“I wish I was the strongest man in the world!” Amenhotep wished. 

“Very well”, said the fairy, “but you must always use your strength to help others.” Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles. 

The fairy turned to Set “And what is your wish, Set?”
Set responded “I never want to be poor again! I wish for money!”

“Very well,” said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. “Greetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!”

“Elmon is an expert in all things money,” said the fairy, “He will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.”

Amenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname “Imp”. With Elmon’s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.  

Years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep. 

Ep and Set’s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business. 

As all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the the HQ in Cairo to learn business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.

Josep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.

Upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature’s effect on Set’s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.

Josep was shocked, and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.

Amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.

Without the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set’s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. “Come, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let’s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.”

Set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon’s murder.

The case was brought before the court, but Set’s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.

He looked into a garden and saw a well-dressed man in a suit, crying and looking into a swimming pool.

The man in the suit filled his pockets with rocks, and suddenly jumped into the pool, still crying. The homeless man wasted no time in jumping in, to drag the other man out of the water.

After the man in the suit had taken some moments to recover and process what was happening (and what he was doing), he thanked the homeless man profusely and asked if there was any way he could repay him for his kindness.

""What was I thinking?!"" the man in suit said, ""Please good sir, I must reward you for what you have done for me.  Money is no obstacle, and you can have anything you want.  How can I repay you?"" ""I don't need money."" the homeless man replied. ""But I would like a job if there is a way that you can arrange that.

The well-dressed man was taken aback by this request but complied, saying that the homeless man could work on one of the commercial cruise ships that his company owned.

A few weeks later the captain of this cruis ship was inspecting his new subordinate and was disgusted by his appearance.  ""We can't have a homeless man running around on this ship, because it will put off the guests.  You can be a janitor, but only if you promise to only leave your employee cabin to work at night when the guests are asleep.""

The homeless man was not bothered by the captain's comments, and got to work as a night janitor on the ship.

One night he finished his work early, and decided to swim in the pool while no one was around.

Unfortunately the first hand came on deck just as the homeless man began to dive into the pool.  Instead of being outraged, he was amazed at the perfect dive that the homeless man pulled off.

The first mate insisted he do it again for the captain.  After being shown the skill of this homeless man the captain was amazed. He insisted that the homeless man put on diving shows for the customers.

Weeks later the homeless man was about to attempt the tallest dive possible for his newly gained fans. The diving board was set up especially for the occasion, and it extended impossibly high into the sky.

The man began climbing and climbing. Hours passed before he reached the top of the board. He looked to the pool far below, but was completely unphased.  With a couple of stretches, he dove straight down, aiming for the pool below. Down, down and down he went, picking up speed, until he hit terminal velocity on his dive.  He hit the water at an incredible speed, and sliced right through the water, straight to the bottom of the pool.

He didn't stop though, and smashed through the bottom of the pool, and through each of the 30 decks below, until he broke right through the bottom of the ship, into the open ocean.

Commotion immediately broke out on the ship.  ""Man overboard!""  People were shouting, and frantically threw life preservers to the homeless man.

He caught a life preserver and was hoisted up onto the ship again.

POOPSCRUFFIN4U / Sasha here. The point of this post is to do a bit of a status update / history of the sub, remind everyone of the rules, and make an attempt to reinvigorate the quality of content posted here. Feel free to scroll to the **RULES AND WARNINGS** section of this post to skip all the (probably not very relevant to you) background stuff that's directly below.

-----

Most of you already know me as a regular poster on Standupshots. I have also been a mod for a while. Standupshots lubricated my entry into the stand-up comedy world back in 2019, was one of my only outlets during the pandemic, and allowed me to connect with other comedians and comedy lovers far beyond my local sphere. I suspect this place has also been a key stepping stone to the success of some now-famous comedians, e.g. Gianmarco Soresi and Geoffrey Asmus. Don’t misinterpret this; these two are famous because they are consistently very funny and put in the work, but I remember Standupshots being one of the first places they’d routinely go viral before becoming full-time comics who sold comedy clubs out all over the world. I think Standupshots can be valuable in this way to other comedians as well.

Recently, I was granted the supreme honor (/s) of basically being the only active mod on this sub because it's dying and moderating it sucks. Two years ago, a D+ joke would easily clear 1k karma if posted at the right time in the morning. Now an A+ joke struggles to clear 400 no matter when it's posted. People are disengaging with this place, and the overall energy here is pretty negative.

There are a few reasons for this, but most glaring is the fact that the set of comedians who post here has shrunk to a very small group of people who A) post too often, B) submit stuff that barely or doesn't even constitute comedy, and/or C) post jokes that are mid at best. Yeah yeah, comedy is ""subjective"", but it's also not. If you post a picture of yourself doing comedy next to the text “So I went to the store today. The store! Can you believe it?”, you are driving people away from the sub. You’re probably also being oblivious. This is a bad quality for a comedian to have, no matter what their schtick is.

Your number one goal on any subreddit, in my opinion, should NOT be to acquire karma; rather, it should be to give people who are subscribed to that subreddit the experience they are looking for through their subscription. Here, it’s to laugh at jokes written out within the static visual context of their writers. If you’re not facilitating that experience, you should think about why. If everyone in the comments is baffled as to why the content was posted, you have failed. The same applies to doing stand-up for a paying audience; you are there to entertain said audience, not to use them for your ego. Whatever emotional karma you get from the experience is secondary to providing entertainment.

Previous mods here have been very strict about removing hateful comments; as a mod, I have been adamant that negative comments on my own posts stay up so that A) people can see how stupid hecklers can be and B) I can publicly ridicule them. I also have a few stalkers (brag), and I have no problem with them embarrassing themselves; it's an opportunity for material, tbh. However, I know that not all comedians want to see a bunch of rude comments (even when the comments don’t make any sense and are clearly being written by sad smoothbrains), so I will be pretty stringent with comments left on any posts that aren't my own unless the comedian openly welcomes the hate train. Or if the comedian is clearly a complete asshole, in which case I will ban.

With that said, part of the mission statement here at Standupshots is to provide a space for constructive feedback. I don’t think this is the MAIN point of the subreddit, and 99% of the feedback I’ve seen on here is either bad, wrong, empty, or inactionable. But every now and then, I have seen people provide genuinely insightful commentary and even offer helpful ideas for tags, rewrites, and so forth. This is good, and I encourage it. Of course, some commenters leave whole novels in the comments giving terrible advice, so be advised if you are a comic that not everything in the comments is worth your time to read. Most of it isn't.

The previous “mod in charge”, as it were, was going to freeze Standupshots and leave it in an essentially ""read-only"" mode if I didn't agree to take over as the new chief mod. Maybe that’s what should happen. But whether due to my own nostalgia or hubris, I would like to see this sub undergo a renaissance.

**Here is a list of things you can do to help:**

1. Encourage comedians you know to post jokes that you like and think work well in text. If they aren't familiar with the subreddit, show them a post you like that's formatted well to illustrate how it's done. Let them know posting here can be a useful way for them to publicize their social media accounts, a tour, album release, or anything else related to their comedy! Former mod Nathan Anderson was my model for how to create content for this subreddit, and [this post of his is a simple template worth emulating.](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F8b103z4704z31.jpg) You can easily create posts from a standard template using phone apps like Canva or AddText.

2. Be mindful that people on here are reading your joke, not witnessing it in real time, so think harder about word economy than you would if delivering a joke live. Also, think about formatting the text in ways that helps translate delivery into a visual context. Line breaks, ellipses--that sort of stuff. Make it easy to read the joke and feel the pacing through its visual presentation.

3. Leave helpful comments. ""I don't like this joke"" is not actionable feedback. If you don't like it and have nothing useful to say, just downvote and move on. And if you simply can't resist sharing your opinion, think about why you don't like the joke and elaborate before posting it.

4. Read the comments before posting yours. Somebody probably already said what you came to the comments to say. Upvote/downvote or reply to them instead of flooding the comments with redundancies.

5. If you like something that was posted here, share it! Tag the comedian! Do it up! We love that.

6. Look at the whole post before asking who the comedian is. Submitters are required to credit their submissions to spare you this effort.

7. Feel free, as a non-comedian, to submit content. Just make sure it's credited properly. I especially encourage you to do this with lesser-known comedians and jokes that you are especially fond of.

8. Don't scrape the bottom of the barrel for the material you post here. As stated above, your posts actually aren't primarily about you. They're about your audience--specifically, making them laugh. Just because that one guy at the open mic who laughs at everything made you think your joke is funny doesn't mean it is.

# RULES AND WARNINGS WHERE I TELL YOU YOU’RE STUPID

**1. Do not insult the comedian’s physical appearance.** This is tempting to do because many comedians are extremely unattractive. However, you should let them make the jokes about this. If a comedian has posted a joke about their appearance and you have a non-hurtful tag to share that’s in the same vein, that’s fine. 

**2. No insulting the comedian’s talent or career.** One of the top stupid comments I see on here is people telling people to quit comedy after seeing one single example of the submitter’s comedy. If you do this, you are stupid.

**3. Submissions must feature a photo of the comedian.** I will add to this that if you choose illegible text or do stuff like putting white font on a yellow background, you are stupid. Make this shit legible if you want us to read the joke.

**4. Don’t post stuff without appropriate credit.** Regardless of whether you are posting your own material or someone else’s, this means at the very least including the comedian’s name in the post. I encourage you to also include info about social media etc.

**5. Original content preferred.** You can post jokes by other people if you credit them, but the majority of what’s posted here should be by the comedians themselves.

**6. No accusations of spam/self-promotion.** I will decide what is spam. As to self-promotion, that’s one of the main points of the subreddit.

**7. No bigotry regarding gender or sexual orientation.** This includes includes leaving comments like “Oh, does your vagina hurt?” when the male submitter gets butthurt about someone not liking their joke. You are making it way too obvious that someone with a vagina hurt you and now you’re taking it out on a stranger. Get it together. You are an idiot. Any if you leave anything along the lines of “Women shouldn’t do comedy” on anyone’s posts besides mine (I enjoy these sorts of comments, but most people don’t need to see that bullshit because it’s frankly very unoriginal and also false), you will be banned. And are stupid.

**8. No accusations of vote manipulation.** One of the other top stupid comments I see on here is people being flabbergasted by a post doing better than they think it should and attributing the karma to the influence of bots. If you do this, you are a raging imbecile and I will ban you without any warning whatsoever. I hate when people do this, it’s literally even stupider than misogyny. Yes, I said it. 

**9. No pictures of tweets.** If you need me to explain this further, you are stupid. This rule shouldn't have to exist given the details of Rule 3, but that just goes to show you how stupid people on this subreddit have been.

# SOFT RULES IN A NEW ERA OF DICTATORSHIP BY SOMEONE WITH THE WORD “POOP” IN THEIR USERNAME

**1. Don’t post every goddamn day.** I don’t have a hard rule for this (notice how this section is titled starting with “soft rules…”), but if most of the recent posts in this sub are by you, you are posting too much. I will warn you if you’re doing this and then ban you if it continues–even if your content is funny. This subreddit is not your personal fleshlight.

**2. Don’t post unfunny material or non-jokes.** “Who decides what’s a joke, Sasha? Who decides what makes a joke good?” The answer is: Me. I do. This is a dictatorship now. I will judge submissions based on my own opinion in conjunction with audience reaction (karma, comment content and distribution, etc.). Those of you who were here over the last couple months probably remember a few people who kept repeatedly posting things that were aggressively unfunny, and learning nothing from it. I banned them. They were ruining the sub. This place is most fun when some of the content is mid, a small amount is bad, and most of it is damn decent. If you flood this place with nonsense, I will ban you. If you post one dud, that’s fine. But if it’s rare that anything you post is even remotely funny, good grief. Get your mind right.

**3. Don’t leave stupid comments (see the hard rules).** This applies to submitters and non-submitters. Did you just tell the submitter to quit comedy based on the one and only example of their comedy you’ve ever seen? You are a moron. Are you the comedian being insulted, and have elected to respond by saying butthurt things like “Well this works live!” or “Actually, this joke is good! I have done it at 4,000 open mics!”? You are also a moron. Both of you need to touch grass and recalibrate the way you approach things you don’t like (hint: try being funny. That’s actually super welcome here). And for the love of god stop accusing everyone of stealing jokes. If they wanted to steal jokes, they'd steal better ones. Parallel thinking is extremely common in stand-up and rules about word economy and joke formulas often yield very similar verbiage, especially for short jokes.

**4. NO SIMPING!!!!!!!**

I do a joke about someone being so high it looks like they’re walking through waist high oatmeal. In the pantomime of that I scoop up a handful of imaginary oatmeal. That’s what’s happening in this photo. You can hear the joke on my album Swing for the Fences. It’s a visual joke so I had my friend and hilarious comic Ed Bailey join me on stage to narrate the joke for the listeners. It’s very silly. 

If you just love listening to stuff here’s the obligatory plug for my podcast Milks of the World. I co-host it with my buddy Alex Stypula. He’s very mean to me on the podcast but don’t worry he doesn’t mean it that’s just our dynamic. He bought me pizza last night. Delicious delicious pizza. (Pizzeria Davide in Pittsburgh if you’re wondering). 

I’m already writing a book on here so why not continue? I’m currently lying on his coach cuz we have a sleepover every two weeks to record the podcast. We’re recording a couple episodes today. We have a subreddit at /r/MilksOfTheWorld stop by and say hi. ",,False
